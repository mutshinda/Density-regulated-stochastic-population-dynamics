# Density-regulated-stochastic-population-dynamics
R and OpenBUGS code for the paper "Density regulation amplifies environmentally induced population fluctuations"

This repositiry includes R code for simulating population time series from the stochastic Gompertz model, 
as well as  OpenBUGS code for fitting the stochastic Gompertz et stochastic Ricker modelsto simulated data
with a Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques
